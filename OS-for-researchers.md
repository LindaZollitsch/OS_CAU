## Introduction

-----

* What does Open Science mean?

* How can I be open in my research?

* What is the benefit of Open Science?

-----

## Questions that tackle the topic of Open Science:

-----

* In what format should I save videos for long-term archiving?

* Where can I store my sensitive data?

* How do I make my data anonymous?

* Am I allowed to put data from Facebook, I use in a study, in a repository open access?

* What happens to my data when I leave the university?

* How can I share large amounts of data with others during the project?

* How can retrieve my data?

* Part of the data collected was not used in the publication(s). Do I still have to share this data even if it’s not connected to any publication?

>"The term Open Science bundles strategies and procedures that aim to consistently use the opportunities of digitisation to make all components of the scientific process openly accessible, comprehensible and reusable via the internet. This is intended to open up new possibilities for science, society and the economy in dealing with scientific findings.
>
>The goal is to improve the quality of research and to use research funding more efficiently. Open Science is thus an important component of ensuring good scientific practice. In addition, the transfer of knowledge to society, the economy and politics is to be improved through openness and transparency.
>
>Open Science is based on four fundamental principles:
>
>* Transparency
>
>* Reproducibility
>
>* Reusability
>
>* Open communication"

"A key element of open science is to claim for openness of digital research and teaching. This means that research results, research data, research methods and procedures as well as course and teaching content, software and tools are available free of charge and can be reused." 

(Kunst, Sabine & Degkwitz, Andreas. (2019). Open Science - the new paradigm for research and education?. 10.18452/19871.)

## Open Science in practice: Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)

* **How can I be open in my research?**

* What is the benefit of Open Science?

********************************************************************************
"A persistent identifier (PI or PID) is a long-lasting reference to a document, file, web page, or other digital object. Most PIDs have a unique identifier which is linked to the current address of the metadata or content. Unlike URLs, PIDs are often provided by services that allow you to update the location of the object so that the identifierconsistently points to the right place without breaking."

(https://guides.lib.uw.edu/research/PID#:~:text=A%20persistent%20identifier%20(PI%20or,of%20the%20metadata%20or%20content.)

********************************************************************************

{{3}}
********************************************************************************
>"A persistent identifier (PID) is a long-lasting reference to a digital resource and provides the information required to reliably identify, verify and locate your research data eliminating many misunderstandings. A PID may also be connected to a set of metadata which describes a digital resource." 
>
>(https://howtofair.dk/how-to-fair/persistent-identifiers/)

********************************************************************************


### Digital Object Identifier (DOI)

-----

{{1}}
********************************************************************************
>"A DOI is a digital identifier of an object, any object — physical, digital, or abstract. DOIs solve a common problem: keeping track of things. Things can be matter, material, content, or activities.
>
>A DOI is a unique number made up of a prefix and a suffix separated by a forward slash. This is an example of one: 10.1000/182. It is resolvable using our proxy server by displaying it as a link: https://doi.org/10.1000/182.
>
>Designed to be used by humans as well as machines, DOIs identify objects persistently. They allow things to be uniquely identified and accessed reliably. You know what you have, where it is, and others can track it too." 
>
>(https://www.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/)

-----

********************************************************************************

{{2}}
********************************************************************************
"A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a unique identifier that you can use to enable your data or datasets to be cited just like bibliographic references or other scholarly resources. A DOI will help make research outputs, such as datasets, more findable and citable. DOIs allow for your datasets to be tracked through metrics systems, such as Almetric, which you can use to measure the use and impact of your data." 

(https://libguides.library.usyd.edu.au/datapublication/step6)

********************************************************************************

********************************************************************************
>"DOIs are persistent identifiers to uniquely and permanently identify physical, digital and abstract objects following international standards (ISO 26324)."

### ORCID

-----

-----

{{1-2}}
********************************************************************************
* Have you alredy heard of ORCID?

* Do you have an ORCID?

********************************************************************************

{{2}}
********************************************************************************
**What is a ORCID?**

* 16-digit number and the associated record that stores automatic links to all your research, and links all your research with you

* Disambiguates researchers, and connects people with their research activities

* Serves as an information hub, enabling your authors and reviewers to reliably connect to their contributions

* Discover information about pepole you work with

********************************************************************************

## Benefits of Persistent Identifiers

-----

* easy to identify objects or persons

* machine-readable

* long-lasting reference

* verifyable

* reliable

* publishing data while being sure that they are connected to the author

-----

## What does it have to do with Open Science?

-----

Think about the following:

-----

{{1}}
********************************************************************************

* You want to write an article and like to cite someone / want to use someone's data

* You want to know what other articles/data a person has published

* You want to publish an article/data and want to ensure that you will be cited

********************************************************************************

{{2}}
********************************************************************************
**Open Science encompasses the most diverse aspects of science.**

>* Open Access describes access to (mostly) text-based works.
>
>* Open Data refers (mostly) to research data, media data and others. 
>
>* Open Peer Review regulates the review of articles before / for publication.
>
>* Open Source and Open Hardware address the publication of software and hardware.
>
>* Citizen Science actively involves citizens in research.

**All these aspects can be seen als part of open science**

A warm-up question to start the topic:

During his research project, Ali has collected a large amount of research data that he would like to publish Open Access in line with FAIR principles. To comply with good research practice, Ali ensures that his data ...

    [[ ]] is stored on FAIR foundation servers. 
    [[X]] is machine-readable using metadata.
    [[ ]] can be found in any database. 
    [[ ]] do not contain information about the sexual orientation of the participants. 
    
Ali's decision is in line with good research practice because ...

    [[ ]] it ensures equal treatment of all research data.
    [[ ]] it is his duty to do so. 
    [[ ]] the legal framework of universities requires it.
    [[ ]] it ensures reliable research results.

{{4}} Were you confident in your choice of a practice and in the rationale? Do you consider another rationale to be the right one? The warm-up question is not about the answer being universally valid for all time, but about the current understanding within the scientific community. This can, of course, change over time, so consider the "correct" rationale we provide as an offer of discussion and reflection of your own perspective.
